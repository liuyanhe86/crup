The	O
solution	O
is	O
to	O
simply	O
replace	O

your	O
own	O
(	O
using	O
i.e	O
.	O
QLabel	Library_Class
)	O
.	O

One	O
way	O
around	O
that	O
challenge	O
is	O
to	O
use	O
a	O
Dojo	Library_Class
ContentPane	Library_Class
.	O

Use	O
a	O
hashtable	Library_Class
to	O
store	O
your	O
attributes	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
create	O
an	O
instance	O
of	O
the	O
logger	O
in	O
the	O
FileHandler	Library_Class
,	O
so	O
I	O
can	O
use	O
the	O
log	O
method	O
and	O
format	O
the	O
string	O
as	O
designed	O
in	O
the	O
Formatter	Library_Class
.	O

my	O
combobox	Library_Class
values	O

So	O
use	O
a	O

the	O
remaining	O

If	O
there	O
are	O
24	O

you	O
update	O
the	O

I	O
